# Project Summary:
As part of TOP curriculum, I was tasked with creating a working tic tac toe game in the browser with the optional feature of a computer as. a player's opponent. 

# Goals:
* Working tic tac toe game in browser
* Use as little global code as possible
* Design with factory function and module pattern
* Checks for and announces winners

# Reflection:
This was the most challenging project since the calculator. However, I really enjoyed the challenge. I only had some minor difficulties that were quickly solved by asking questions in the TOP discord. This project gave me a great opportunity to become more comfortable with IIFEs and the factory function. I have to say that it's actually quite fun minimizing global code and it definitely organizes things more than just having a mess of everything in the global scope. Speaking of scope, it’s one area that I had a few troubles with but I was eventually able to figure it out. Overall, I’m very much satisfied with my progress in the curriculum. One thing I learned is to never stay stuck on something for too long. Maybe a max of thirty minutes and after that I should seek some help if possible. I hope to revisit this later after progressing further through the JS portion of the curriculum to implement an unbeatable AI and possibly clean up the code as well!
